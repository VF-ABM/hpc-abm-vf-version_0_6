To build and run program:
1. From terminal, navigate to main directory 
2. Build using 'make'
3. Run test_not_main.cpp using './bin/testRun'
Note: You may need to clear the make cache and update the source and build directories in the makefile

NOTE: 
-Cmake folder contains the essential files for compiling CUDA C code. DO NOT TOUCH THAT FOLDER!!!!
-findCudaTests contains files copied by findCUDA. Used to for compiling testing reasons only. Consider erasing later. 
-cuda_bin is the bin file associated with the findCudaTests examples. For some reason, only the intermediary files are put there, the exe. are still in bin.
