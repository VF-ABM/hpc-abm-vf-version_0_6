     *        The check is to make sure that we are reading from the most 
     *        up-to-date information of the cell. This check is necessary,
     *        since move() can be called multiple times in a tick, thus could
     * 		    potentially modify each attribute more than once. The 
     *        intermediate values need to be kept track of.
